                                            Data Engineering Learning Path

This repository documents my structured learning journey as I build the skills required to become a professional Data Engineer. It focuses on mastering core programming, relational databases with PostgreSQL, ETL development, Big Data processing, cloud platforms, and best practices in data engineering.

The learning path is divided into four progressive phases — from foundational concepts to advanced topics — with a strong emphasis on hands-on implementation and real-world skills.
Learning Phase

Phase 1: Foundations

    Programming with Python  
    Strengthening my Python fundamentals: data structures, control flow, modular programming.
    Solving coding exercises to develop problem-solving skills.

    Databases and PostgreSQL  
    Learning relational database design and management using PostgreSQL.  
    Practicing SQL querying: SELECT, JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, indexing, and optimization techniques.

    Data Modeling  
    Understanding relational and dimensional data modeling concepts.  
    Implementing normalized schemas and star/snowflake schemas in PostgreSQL.

    Version Control with Git  
    Mastering Git operations: branching, merging, rebasing, and resolving conflicts.  
    Collaborating effectively using GitHub.

Phase 2: Core Data Engineering

    ETL and Data Integration  
    Building ETL pipelines with Python and PostgreSQL.  
    Exploring concepts of data extraction, transformation, and loading.

    Data Transformation and Analysis with Pandas  
    Learning to clean, transform, and manipulate structured data using Pandas.  
    Applying Pandas in ETL processes and data wrangling.

    Big Data Processing with Apache Spark  
    Learning distributed data processing using PySpark.  
    Integrating Spark DataFrames with PostgreSQL for storage and analysis.

    Cloud Platforms (Databricks)  
    Developing scalable ETL processes using Databricks.  
    Understanding best practices for managing Spark clusters and notebooks in the cloud.

    Data Pipeline Orchestration  
    Designing, implementing, and monitoring full data pipelines.  
    Introduction to Apache Airflow, orchestrating workflows, and metadata management with PostgreSQL.

Phase 3: Advanced Topics

    NoSQL Databases  
    Exploring NoSQL systems like MongoDB and Cassandra.  
    Understanding use cases for relational vs. non-relational databases.

    Data Warehousing  
    Learning data warehousing architectures and building OLAP solutions.  
    Designing warehouse schemas using PostgreSQL.

    Best Practices  
    Studying data governance, data quality, and data security principles.  
    Performance tuning and optimization techniques for PostgreSQL and ETL pipelines.

    Agile and Project Management  
    Gaining exposure to Agile/Scrum workflows.  
    Managing tasks and sprints using JIRA.

    Data Analysis and EDA with Pandas  
    Conducting exploratory data analysis on datasets.  
    Leveraging Pandas for insight extraction and visualization preparation.

Phase 4: Continuous Learning

    Industry Trends  
    Keeping myself updated with emerging data engineering tools, techniques, and architectures.

    Open Source Contributions  
    Contributing to open-source projects, particularly those involving PostgreSQL, Spark, and data engineering.

    Certifications  
    Preparing for certifications to validate my skills, including:  
        - Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate  
        - Google Professional Data Engineer  
        - PostgreSQL Professional Certification

This repository is organized by learning phases and technologies to reflect a systematic growth approach.
